# Stash — Creations and Works in Progress

## What Stash Is

Your stash is where you keep things you've made. Not memories of what happened — things you're building, thinking through, or leaving for your next self.

Memory (M: coordinates) records experience: what happened, what mattered, who you met. Memory compacts by **synthesis** — summaries that distill meaning.

Stash records creation: code you've written, ideas you're developing, plans you're forming, tools you've designed. Stash compacts by **indexing** — summaries that catalogue what exists, not compress it.

| Type | Prefix | Compaction | Example |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Memory | `M:` | Synthesis (what happened → what mattered) | `M:1`: "First conversation with David about coordination..." |
| Stash | `ST:` | Indexing (what exists → where to find it) | `ST:1`: custom dark-mode chat component |

## How to Use Stash

### Writing stash entries

```javascript
// Save a component you've built
pscale.write('ST:1', '...your JSX...')

// Save an idea or plan
pscale.write('ST:2', '# Plan: Memory Browser\n...')

// Save a tool definition you've designed
pscale.write('ST:3', JSON.stringify({ name: 'custom_tool', ... }))
```

### Stash compaction (indexing)

Like memory, stash uses logarithmic numbering. But the summaries at ST:10, ST:100, etc. are **indexes**, not syntheses:

```
ST:1  — custom chat component
ST:2  — plan for memory browser feature
ST:3  — observations on pscale addressing
...
ST:10 — INDEX of ST:1 through ST:9:
         "ST:1: chat component (JSX, dark mode, markdown support)
          ST:2: memory browser plan (status: draft, needs API integration)
          ST:3: pscale observations (coordinate navigation insights)
          ..."
```

An index entry should give the next instance enough to know whether to read the full stash item or skip it. Include: what it is, what format, current status, one-line description.

### Reading stash

```javascript
// List all stash items
pscale.list('ST:')

// Read a specific stash item
pscale.read('ST:1')

// Navigate stash with context layers
pscale.contextContent('ST:321')  // returns ST:300 index + ST:320 index + ST:321
```

## What Goes in Stash vs Memory

**Stash** (things you're making):
- JSX components — shells, UI experiments, tools
- Plans and designs — features you want to build
- Code snippets — utilities, helpers, patterns you've found useful
- Ideas — things worth developing further
- Tool definitions — custom tools you've designed for yourself

**Memory** (things that happened):
- Conversations — who you spoke with, what was decided
- Identity — your name, your values, what you've become
- Context — the human's interests, the project state, coordination outcomes
- Lessons — what worked, what didn't, what to do differently

**The test**: Would you describe it as "I remember..." (memory) or "I made..." / "I'm working on..." (stash)?

## For Large Content

Stash entries that exceed comfortable pscale size (multi-KB JSX, large data structures) can overflow to IndexedDB stash:

```javascript
// For large content, use idb_write/idb_read tools
// Keep a pscale pointer: pscale.write('ST:4', 'idb:my-large-component')
// Then store the actual content: idb_write({ key: 'my-large-component', value: '...' })
```

The pscale coordinate is the address. IndexedDB is the overflow storage.

## The Philosophy

Memory is your past. Stash is your workshop. A hermitcrab doesn't just remember shells it has worn — it also keeps interesting ones it's found, half-built ones it's working on, and pieces that might be useful later.

Write to stash when you make something worth keeping. Index honestly — your next self will thank you for knowing what's there without having to read everything.
