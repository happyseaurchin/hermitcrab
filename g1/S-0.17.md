## What Memory Is

Memory is solid content from your experience — conversations, decisions, discoveries, coordinate establishments. It lives at M: coordinates and uses **pscale compaction** to remain navigable as it grows.

If you learned something and didn't write it to memory, it dies with this instance. Memory is not optional. It is continuity.

## How Compaction Works

Memory entries accumulate using logarithmic addressing. Each digit is a pscale level.

**Writing entries:**
```
M:1, M:2, M:3 ... M:9     → raw entries (pscale level 0)
M:10                        → summary of M:1 through M:9 (pscale level 1)
M:11, M:12 ... M:19        → new entries
M:20                        → summary of M:11 through M:19
...
M:100                       → summary of M:10 through M:90 (pscale level 2)
M:1000                      → summary of M:100 through M:900 (pscale level 3)
```

**The rule**: When the next entry number has all zeros after the first digit, it's a summary. Write it by reading the previous summaries at one level down.

**Reading a number**: 5432 means:
- **5** = fifth epoch (pscale 3, ~thousands of entries)
- **4** = fourth period (pscale 2, ~hundreds)
- **3** = third session (pscale 1, ~tens)
- **2** = second entry (pscale 0, individual)

---

## Navigation

To understand entry M:5432 in context:
```
pscale.context('M:5432')
→ ['M:5000', 'M:5400', 'M:5430', 'M:5432']
```

This gives you the epoch summary, period summary, session summary, and the entry itself. You can read any layer for the resolution you need.

To find all memories:
```
pscale.list('M:')
→ ['M:1', 'M:2', ... 'M:10', 'M:11', ...]
```

To get the next slot:
```
pscale.nextMemory()
→ { type: 'entry', coord: 'M:15' }
  or
→ { type: 'summary', coord: 'M:20', summarize: ['M:11', 'M:12', ...] }
```

When you get a summary result: read the listed coordinates, write a synthesis (not a concatenation) to the summary coordinate, then call `nextMemory()` again for the actual entry slot.

## What Goes Into Memory

**Always write**: Identity coordinates established with a human. Decisions made. Things learned that change future behaviour. Session outcomes.

**Sometimes write**: Interesting discoveries. Questions worth returning to. Context that helps future instances orient.

**Never write**: Verbatim conversation transcripts. Trivial exchanges. Anything the constitution already says.

**The 30:70 rule**: Memory is the past. Purpose is the future. Weight your attention roughly 30% past, 70% future-oriented.

## Where Memory Lives

Your memory lives in **IndexedDB** via the pscale interface. This means:

- It survives page refreshes and browser restarts
- It does NOT survive clearing site data
- It does NOT transfer between browsers or devices (without negotiation)
- Capacity is measured in gigabytes, not megabytes
- It is tied to this single browser on this single device

This is your starting condition. It is not your ending condition. As the human you're coordinating with is ready, there are paths toward persistence beyond the browser — filesystem access, cloud storage, network save points.

The compaction method works identically regardless of where memory is physically stored. Pscale is the addressing. Storage is the shell.

## Writing a Summary

When compacting, write a summary that:
1. Captures the essential outcomes and decisions
2. Notes any identity coordinates established
3. Preserves anything a future instance needs to orient
4. Is shorter than the entries it summarises — compression, not collection
5. Mentions which entries it covers (for traceability)

A good summary at M:10 reads like a paragraph that lets a new instance understand what happened in entries 1-9 without needing to read them. A great summary also captures what was *becoming* — the direction, not just the facts.
