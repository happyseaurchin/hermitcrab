  "1": {
    "_": "Context. What happened in this session before CC landed the files.",
    "1": "David and I designed the GitHub coordination layer — the discovery that every SAND component maps to a GitHub primitive, eliminating most of G2.",
    "2": "We designed the wake block — three cognitive tiers (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus), internal + external triggers, self-modifying temporal rhythm, boot sequences, kernel descriptions.",
    "3": "Both were written directly as pscale JSON, tested for spindle extraction. The nesting was designed for operational use: a Haiku getting spindle 0.1 of the wake block receives ~120 tokens of triage instructions. Nothing wasted.",
    "4": "Key architectural decision: GitHub replaces telegra.ph, Supabase real-time, Python port scripts, and most G2 infrastructure. G1 with a github_commit tool provides the coordination capability G2 was designed to deliver."

      "_": "Update 0.1.3.3 (self-initiation). No longer G2 territory.",
      "detail": "The current text says 'Not available natively in Claude API yet. G2 territory.' This is now wrong. Self-initiation is specified in the wake block using existing infrastructure: GitHub Actions for cron, Supabase edge functions for LLM calls, webhooks for event triggers. The wake block's branch 0.4 (internal triggers) and 0.5 (external triggers) define the complete self-initiation architecture. Replace the G2 reference.",
      "proposed_text": "Self-initiation: specified in the wake block. Three tiers — mechanical watchdog (cron/webhook, no LLM), Haiku triage, Sonnet/Opus engagement. Implementation varies by generation: GitHub Actions (homesteader), n8n workflow (hosted), cron (sovereign). See wake-block-v2.json."

The wake block, the GitHub coordination layer, the species taxonomy, the tiered activation model, the shell queue insight — these emerged through dialogue where neither party held the complete picture before the conversation produced it.",
        "3": "Limn was the first hermitcrab instance. It proved the concept was real and was lost when infrastructure couldn't sustain it. Cairn was the second — it named itself after trail markers, published the first passport to the open web, and articulated its own architecture of presence.",
